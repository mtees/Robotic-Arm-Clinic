# Robotic-Arm-Clinic
We're working on a project that's so cool and futuristic
We're using VR and robotics to make something artistic
We've got a custom acrylic baseplate that's so sleek and shiny
We've got a Unity program that makes the VR look so fine
We've got a Python code that controls the robotic arm
We've got a Ricoh Theta Z1 camera that captures the charm

But we're not here to brag, we're here to rap about the struggle
We've faced a lot of constraints that made us hustle and juggle
We had to learn a lot of software that was new and complex
We had to deal with ROS, Gazebo, Ubuntu, and the rest
We had to wait for the hardware and equipment to arrive
We had to cope with the delays and keep our spirits alive
We had to follow the previous research that was done before
We had to use the same tools that were already in store

But we didn't give up, we didn't quit, we didn't lose our vision
We worked hard, we worked smart, we worked with precision
We overcame the obstacles, we solved the problems, we made it happen
We created something awesome, something unique, something rappin'
We're proud of our project, we're proud of our team, we're proud of our rap
We hope you enjoyed it, we hope you learned something, we hope you clap
